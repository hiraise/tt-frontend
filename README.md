TaskTrail is a modern, open-source, self-hosted task tracking web application built with **Next.js** and TypeScript. The project follows a modular, Clean Architecture-inspired structure for scalability, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Login and signup functionality.
- **State Management**: Client-side state management with Zustand and server-side state with React Query.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first, adaptive UI for all screen sizes.
- **Localization**: Multi-language support for text and images.
- **Reusable Components**: A rich library of UI components and widgets.
- **Centralized Error Handling**: Global and local error management for a consistent user experience.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily add new features and integrations.
- **Testing**: Unit and integration tests with Jest and React Testing Library.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** (App Router, SSR)
- **TypeScript**
- **Zustand** (for client-side state management)
- **React Query** (for server-side state management)
- **Styled-components**
- **Jest** + **React Testing Library**
- **ESLint** for code quality

## Architecture Overview

TaskTrail uses a modular architecture inspired by Clean Architecture principles to ensure a clean separation of concerns, making the codebase scalable and maintainable.

- **`app`**: The entry point of the application, containing routes, layouts, and pages as per the Next.js App Router paradigm.
- **`application`**: Contains the application-specific business rules and use cases. It orchestrates the flow of data between the domain and the infrastructure layers.
- **`domain`**: The core of the application, containing the business logic and entities. This layer is independent of any framework or external dependency.
- **`infrastructure`**: Implements the interfaces defined in the application layer, handling external concerns like API communication, database access, etc.
- **`presentation`**: Contains the UI components, widgets, and everything related to the user interface.
- **`shared`**: A collection of utilities, hooks, constants, and other shared code that can be used across the entire application.
