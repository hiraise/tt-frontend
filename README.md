# TaskTrail

TaskTrail is a modern, open-source, self-hosted task tracking web application built with **Next.js** and TypeScript. The project follows a modular, Clean Architecture-inspired structure for scalability, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Login and signup with Redux Toolkit state management
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first, adaptive UI
- **Localization**: Multi-language support for text and images
- **Reusable Components**: Library of UI components and widgets
- **Centralized Error Handling**: Global and local error management
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily add new features and integrations
- **Go Backend Integration**: In progress (currently using mock API for some features)
- **Testing**: Vitest and Testing Library (coverage expanding)

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** (App Router, SSR-ready)
- **TypeScript**
- **Redux Toolkit**
- **styled-components**
- **Vitest** + **Testing Library**

## Architecture Overview

TaskTrail uses a modular architecture inspired by Clean Architecture principles:

- **App Layer (`app/`)**: Entry points and routing
- **Application Layer (`application/`)**: Use-cases, state, and side effects
- **Domain Layer (`domain/`)**: Core business logic, domain entities, framework-agnostic
- **Infrastructure Layer (`infrastructure/`)**: API clients, config, redux store
- **Presentation Layer (`presentation/`)**: UI components and widgets
- **Shared Layer (`shared/`)**: Utilities, hooks, localization, errors

This structure ensures scalability, maintainability, and a clear separation of concerns.
